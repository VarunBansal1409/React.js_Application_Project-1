# React.js_Application_Project

"This React application displays 10 user profiles fetched from a public API, each shown in a card with details like name, email, phone, address, website, company, and a unique DiceBear avatar. Each card includes three actions: Like (toggles state), Edit (opens a modal to update details), and Delete (asks for confirmation before removing the card). A loading indicator appears when the app starts to ensure smooth data fetching.

The project covers core React concepts such as JSX, props, state, hooks, conditional rendering, and Context API for global state. With clean component structure and styling support from Bootstrap, MUI, Tailwind, or custom CSS, it demonstrates how to build a simple, interactive, and API-driven React UI."
