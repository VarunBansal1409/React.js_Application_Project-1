# User Profile Dashboard
"This is a single-page React application that fetches and displays 10 user profiles from a public REST API. Each profile card shows a dynamically generated avatar using DiceBear, along with user details such as name, email, phone, address, website, and company. A loading indicator is shown while the data is being fetched.

The app includes interactive features like liking a profile, editing user details through a modal, and deleting a profile with confirmation. It demonstrates core React concepts such as components, props, state management using Context API, conditional rendering, API integration, and basic UI styling using a framework like Bootstrap or MUI."
